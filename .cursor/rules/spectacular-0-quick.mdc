# spectacular-0-quick

(ALL) Orchestrates the full pipeline - spec, plan, tasks, implement, validate - in one command.

## User Input

When the user mentions @spectacular-0-quick, treat their message as the feature input.

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Purpose

This command **orchestrates** the complete simplified pipeline:

```
1-spec -> 2-plan -> 3-tasks -> 4-implement -> 5-validate
```

Each step is a separate command that can also be run independently.

## Pipeline Steps

Execute each step in order. Report progress after each step.

### Step 1: Spec (`1-spec`)

**Goal**: Create feature branch and specification

1. Generate branch name (2-4 words from description)
2. Find next feature number (check specs/, branches)
3. Run: `.spectacular/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json`
4. Write simplified spec.md

**Output**: Branch name, spec file path

### Step 2: Plan (`2-plan`)

**Goal**: Generate technical implementation plan

1. Run: `.spectacular/scripts/powershell/setup-plan.ps1 -Json`
2. Write plan.md with tech stack and project structure

**Output**: Plan file path

### Step 3: Tasks (`3-tasks`)

**Goal**: Create actionable task list from spec and plan

1. Read spec.md and plan.md
2. Write tasks.md with checkbox format

**Output**: Tasks file path, task count

### Step 4: Implement (`4-implement`)

**Goal**: Execute each task

For each task in tasks.md:
1. Mark in_progress in TodoWrite
2. Execute the task
3. Mark complete in both TodoWrite AND tasks.md

### Step 5: Validate (`5-validate`)

**Goal**: Verify implementation is production-ready

Run validation checks:
1. Tasks: All marked [x] in tasks.md
2. Build: Run appropriate build command
3. Tests: Run appropriate test command

## Final Report

After all steps complete, report:
- Feature name and branch
- Files created/modified
- Validation status
