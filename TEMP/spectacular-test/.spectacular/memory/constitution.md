# SpecTacular Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Task Completion is Non-Negotiable

Every task must be verifiably complete before marking done:
- Build must succeed without errors
- Tests must pass (if tests exist)
- Task status synced in both tasks.md AND TodoWrite

### II. Simple Steps Over Complex Workflows

Prefer straightforward approaches:
- Use `/spectacular.0-quick` for simple features
- Task format should be plain checkboxes
- Each step should be independently verifiable

### III. Validation Before Completion

No feature is "done" until validated:
- Run `validate-implementation.ps1` before marking complete
- Build + Test + Task completion = minimum bar

### IV. Production-Ready Defaults

Every implementation targets production:
- No placeholder or TODO code in completed tasks
- Error handling included by default
- Security considerations addressed
